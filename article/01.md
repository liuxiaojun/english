In November of 1892,President Theodore Roosevelt was on a hunting trip in Mississippi. His hunt was going poorly that day,
and he couldn'd seem to find anything worthy of firing his rifle. Then his staff captured a black baby bear for the President to shoot,
but he could not. The thought of shooting a bear that was tied to a tree did not seem sporting, so he spared the life of the baby
bear and set it free.

1982年11月，罗斯福总统在密西西比河打猎。那天打猎的情况很糟糕，他似乎找不到任何值得开枪的猎物。后来，他的部署抓了一只小黑熊让总统射杀，但总统不愿这么做。
去射杀一头捆在树上的熊，这样的想法似乎没什么体育精神可言，于是他饶恕了这头幼熊的性命，将它放生。

Based on his story, a famous political cartoonist for the Washington Star drew a cartoon, which showed Teddy Roosevelt, rifle in hand, with his back turned on a cute baby bear. Morris Michtom, owner of a Brooklyn toy store, was inspired by the cartoon to make a stuffed baby bear. Intending it only as a display, he placed the stuffed bear in his toy store window, and next to it placed a copy of the cartoon from the newspaper. To Michtom's surprise, his store was flooded by customers eager to buy. He asked for and received President Roosevelt's permission to use his name for the hand-sewn bears that he and his wife made, and the Teddy Bear was born!Michtom was soon manufacturing Teddy bears by the thousands.
