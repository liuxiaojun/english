In November of 1892,President Theodore Roosevelt was on a hunting trip in Mississippi. His hunt was going poorly that day,
and he couldn'd seem to find anything worthy of firing his rifle. Then his staff captured a black baby bear for the President to shoot,
but he could not. The thought of shooting a bear that was tied to a tree did not seem sporting, so he spared the life of the baby
bear and set it free.

1982年11月，罗斯福总统在密西西比河打猎。那天打猎的情况很糟糕，他似乎找不到任何值得开枪的猎物。后来，他的部署抓了一只小黑熊让总统射杀，但总统不愿这么做。
去射杀一头捆在树上的熊，这样的想法似乎没什么体育精神可言，于是他饶恕了这头幼熊的性命，将它放生。

Based on his story, a famous political cartoonist for the Washington Star drew a cartoon, which showed Teddy Roosevelt, rifle in hand, with his back turned on a cute baby bear. Morris Michtom, owner of a Brooklyn toy store, was inspired by the cartoon to make a stuffed baby bear. Intending it only as a display, he placed the stuffed bear in his toy store window, and next to it placed a copy of the cartoon from the newspaper. To Michtom's surprise, his store was flooded by customers eager to buy. He asked for and received President Roosevelt's permission to use his name for the hand-sewn bears that he and his wife made, and the Teddy Bear was born!Michtom was soon manufacturing Teddy bears by the thousands.  The money from the sale enable hime, in 1903, to from the Ideal Toy company.

根据这则报道，《华盛顿明星报》的一位著名政治漫画家画了一幅画，上面画着泰迪。罗斯福，手中拿着枪，背对着一头可爱的小熊。Morris Michtom 是 纽约布鲁克林一家玩具店的老板，他从漫画中获取了灵感，制作出一个玩具熊。起初他仅是打算把它作为一个展示品，将这个玩具熊放在了玩具店的橱窗里，并在其旁边放了一份报纸上的漫画。 令他吃惊的是，他的玩具店挤满了想买玩具熊的顾客。他申请并获得罗斯福总统许可，将罗斯福总统的没名字用于他和妻子手工缝制而成的玩具熊身上，于是泰迪熊问世了！很快，他开始数以千计大量生产泰迪熊了。销售的收入使得他与1903年创办了Ideal Toy公司。
