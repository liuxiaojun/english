In November of 1892,President Theodore Roosevelt was on a hunting trip in Mississippi. His hunt was going poorly that day,
and he couldn'd seem to find anything worthy of firing his rifle. Then his staff captured a black baby bear for the President to shoot,
but he could not. The thought of shooting a bear that was tied to a tree did not seem sporting, so he spared the life of the baby
bear and set it free.

1982年11月，罗斯福总统在密西西比河打猎。那天打猎的情况很糟糕，他似乎找不到任何值得开枪的猎物。后来，他的部署抓了一只小黑熊让总统射杀，但总统不愿这么做。
去射杀一头捆在树上的熊，这样的想法似乎没什么体育精神可言，于是他饶恕了这头幼熊的性命，将它放生。
