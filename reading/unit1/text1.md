It used to be that people were proud to work for the same company for the whole of their working lives. They'd get a gold watch
at the end of their productive years and a dinner featuring speeches by their bosses praising their loyalty. But today's rich 
capitalists have regressed to the "survival of the fittest" ideas and their loyalty extends not to their workers or even to their loyalty extends not to their workers or even to their 
stockholders but only to themselves. Instead of giving out gold watches worth a hundred or so dollars for forty or so years of 
work, they grab tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars as they sell for their own profit the company they may have been 
with for only a few years.

过去人们以终生供职于一家公司感到自豪。退休时公司会赠与他们金表，给他们举行告别晚宴，晚宴特色是老板发表演说，称赞他们对公司的忠诚。但是，现在富有的资本家
缺倒退到以“适者生存”为理念，他们的忠诚仅限于对他们本身，不再包括员工甚至股东。他们不再为了表征员工在公司工作了40年左右而发给他们价值百八块钱的金表，
而是为了自己的利益吧经营了仅有几年的公司卖掉，而从中获取数千万乃至数亿元的利润。

The new rich selfishly act on their own to undairly grab the wealth that the country as a whole has produced. The top 1 percent of the population now has wealth equal to the whole bottom 95 percent and they want more. Their selfishness is most shamelessly expressed in downsizing and outsourcing because these business maneuvers don't act to create new jobs as the founders of new industries used to do, but only to cut out jobs while keeping the money value of what those jobs produced for themselves.
这些新贵们自私自利，独断专行，不正当的夺取整个国家创造的财富。最富有的这1%的人群，其财富却与占总人数的95%的底层人群的总财富相当，甚至还要获取更多。裁员和业务外包是他们自私之心最无耻的表现，因为这些商业策略不是像过去新产业的创造者们所做的那样去创造就业机会，而是削减就业机会，同时让这些工作为其个人创造的金钱价值不会萎缩。
