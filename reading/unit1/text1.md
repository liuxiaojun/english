It used to be that people were proud to work for the same company for the whole of their working lives. They'd get a gold watch
at the end of their productive years and a dinner featuring speeches by their bosses praising their loyalty. But today's rich 
capitalists have regressed to the "survival of the fittest" ideas and their loyalty extends not to their workers or even to their loyalty extends not to their workers or even to their 
stockholders but only to themselves. Instead of giving out gold watches worth a hundred or so dollars for forty or so years of 
work, they grab tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars as they sell for their own profit the company they may have been 
with for only a few years.

过去人们以终生供职于一家公司感到自豪。退休时公司会赠与他们金表，给他们举行告别晚宴，晚宴特色是老板发表演说，称赞他们对公司的忠诚。但是，现在富有的资本家
缺倒退到以“适者生存”为理念，他们的忠诚仅限于对他们本身，不再包括员工甚至股东。他们不再为了表征员工在公司工作了40年左右而发给他们价值百八块钱的金表，
而是为了自己的利益吧经营了仅有几年的公司卖掉，而从中获取数千万乃至数亿元的利润。
