Anthony:Hi, Rachel. Now that our first advertisement campaign is wrapping up, I think some promotional events would be a good idea now. Do you have any expertise in planning promotional events?
安东尼：嗨，瑞秋。现在我们的第一次广告活动即将结束，我认为现在举办一些促销活动是个好主意。你有策划促销活动的专业知识吗？

Rachel:Yes, I do. First I'd like to pitch the idea of having an in-store promotion. 'Buy one get 50 percent off on the next purchase.'
瑞秋：是的，我想。首先，我想介绍一下店内促销的想法。“买一件，下次买五折。'

Anthony:Okay, that sounds great. I'm afraid in-store promotions will not be sufficient since we don't have many authorized retailers in North America yet.
安东尼：好吧，听起来不错。恐怕店内促销还不够，因为我们在北美还没有很多授权零售商。


Rachel:Online sales make up a large proportion of your total sales if I'm not mistaken, so we could carry out some promotional events for your online customers.
瑞秋：如果我没记错的话，在线销售在你们的总销售额中占很大比例，所以我们可以为你们的在线客户开展一些促销活动。





Anthony:I agree. It's time that we put online promotions on the table. We are planning to offer a gift to every first-time customer who registers on our site.
安东尼：我同意。是时候把在线促销放在桌面上了。我们计划为每一位在我们网站上注册的首次客户提供一份礼物。


Rachel:That's a really smart move. I'd suggest that adding free shipping would be a good plus for your promotional event as well. Also, discounts are necessary for online sales. What discounts would you like to offer your online customers?
瑞秋：这真是个聪明的举动。我建议增加免费送货对你的促销活动来说也是一个很好的加分项。此外，在线销售需要折扣。您想为在线客户提供哪些折扣？


Anthony:'Buy one get 50 percent off on the next purchase.' Do you have anything else to add?
安东尼：买一个，下次买五折。“你还有什么要补充的吗？

Rachel:We'll launch the advertising campaign for your promotional event two weeks before they actually start. At that time, the only thing you'll need to do is have enough staff to take care of increased traffic on your site.

瑞秋：我们会在你们的促销活动真正开始前两周启动广告活动。那时，你唯一需要做的就是有足够的工作人员来处理你网站上增加的流量。
