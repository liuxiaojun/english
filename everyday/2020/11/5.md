## Talking sides
Self-guided tours are becoming more popular than ever in China. Instead of traveling with groups. I prefer to travel alone, so I can go wherever and whenever i like. Thanks to the Internet, I can easily plan my trips by booking online, such as hotel rooms, flight tickets, taxis ans so on. After trying for dozens of times. I'm now totally into online booking, as it saves me not only time but also energy. What's more,one can always use a discount coupon on these booking websites!   

Canceling a flight ticket can be a very diffcult thing to do, as from my past experience with Luckyticket.com. As a businesswoman, I usually need to travel to many cities. I once bought a plane ticket to London viatheir website. However, my booking was canceled due to "overbooking". I immediately made a phone call to their customer service. They apologized and arranged me a new ticket at a different time. After this bad experience. I decide I'd never buy tickets from this website again.
