## Reference
Ruby plans to take a tour of a few Asian countries which may cost her 3.000 dollars.
It's really a large amount of money. She has saved some money, but it's not enough. Therefore, she turns to her mom for help. Her mom agrees to give her support.
but says "save up for your holiday" so Ruby will try to find another part-time job.
Apart from it, she will reduce her everyday costs, because in the past Ruby often bought clothes that she hardly ever wore.
