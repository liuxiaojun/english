Linda is overseas in the U.K. She would like to transfer some money from a checking account to a savings account. The bank teller James tells her to fill out
a form and put down the amount she is transfering. After Linda finishes the form, James suggests that Linda double-check whether she has written the 
account number down correctly. Linda also asks James to withdraw 300 pounds from her account. In the end, James thinks it is a pleasure assisting Linda.
