## Reference
My friend Maggie tells me about her unforgettable experence of getting lost in New York. One day she got off at the wrong station and lost her guidebook. She checked her phone's map and looked for the road signs. She ended up walking around near the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She had been there once, so she was able to make it back to her hotel from there.
