* Tom: Hi, I'm Tom. I called you earlier to see the apartment.
* Julia: Nice to meet you, Mr. Miller. I've been waiting for you. This way, please. This apartment is well-decorated and well-lit. You can look around first.
* Tom: Thanks. How far is it from the nearest subway station?
* Julia: It's about a ten-minute walk to the nearest subway station. You can also find many buses near here. It's very convenient to go almost anywhere.
* Tom: That's good. How much is the rent?
* Julia: Two thousand dollars a month.
* Tom: Well, are all the utilities included in the rent?
* Julia: Yes, the electricity, water and gas are all included, but you need to pay for the garbage collection.
* Tom: OK. I will think about it and call you as soon as I make a decision.
* Julia: If you have any questions about the apartment, please call me anytime.
